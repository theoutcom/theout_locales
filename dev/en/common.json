There are no administration or additional fees.

If the accident or damage is deemed to be your fault, then you are liable up to the {deposit} deposit amount, i.e. THE OUT charges your payment card with the previously authorised {deposit} in accordance with the damage value. THE OUT will not charge you more than {deposit}, even if the damage exceeds {deposit}. If the damage is below {deposit}, then the damage amount is charged and the difference reimbursed.\n2. If the accident was not your fault, we have to capture the deposit until the liability has been established between the two insurance companies. If both insurance companies agree that you are not at fault, then the {deposit} deposit will be reimbursed. If the insurance companies decide that you were at fault, then case 1 applies.\nAdditional drivers can be added to your rental at no extra cost.

    "PORTER_AND_SAIL_PACKAGES": "-PACKAGE 01\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE\nAnother slammed week of video calls, meetings and some more calls. You want your freedom. Leave the week and the city behind you, with this ready-made weekend escape including some two-wheel action. \nOnce you have booked and had your car delivered, head to Barnett Hill Hotel in Surrey to explore some of the countryside's finest cycling routes. Then on day two, drive an hour to Kent's Rowhill Grange and enjoy the sprawling grounds.  We suggest booking a Land Rover Discovery Sport and of course the complimentary bike rack.\n[car|Land Rover Discovery Sport, bed|2 nights at 4* Barnett Hill Hotel, cycling|Cycling]\n-PACKAGE 02\nTHE ECO DETOX WEEKEND\nWe live and work in hectic times. But there is always room for a little reset, detox and recharge. More green. More fresh air. More outside. More woosah. \nHow about taking the all-electric Jaguar I-PACE on a very quiet roadtrip for two nights to relax and decompress at Alexander House? A Jacobean manor tucked away in West Sussex on 120 acres of beautiful gardens. Whilst there, enjoy complimentary access to the Utopia Spa and a bottle of Nyetimber bubbly on arrival.\n[car|Jaguar I-PACE, bed|2 nights at 5* Alexander House, spa|Utopia Spa]\n-PACKAGE 03\nTHE MICHELIN STAR WEEKEND\nFood, glorious food. All weekend long at Great Fosters, a charming Tudor estate located just outside of Windsor in the heart of Surrey.

Available in four colorways and made of soft Oxford leather, they feature touches such as SVR embossing on the upper bolster and embody sporting refinement.\\b Because the cars are super special and one of a kind, they unfortunately can’t be driven by just anyone.
